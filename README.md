  # WK14C-Tech Blog

  ## Description
  This repo contains code for a "Tech Blog Website". On my own, I was tasked with 
  designing a CMS style blog site where users could publish articles, blog posts, and their 
  thoughts and opinions. For this project, alognside Node.js I used:
  * bcrypt
  * connect-session-sequelize
  * dotenv
  * express
  * express-handlebars
  * expres-session
  * mysql2
  * sequelize
  
  With all of these elements, i was able to create a fully functional Website that fit all of the
  criteria. A link to this website can be found [here](#usage)
